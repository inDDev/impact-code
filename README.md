## Welcome to Impact Code, an initiative by inDDev

Impact Code is designed on the belief that everyone wants to leave behind something that is greater than the sum of their life. It stems from a desire to go beyond professional challenges and take on life challenges. 

Sometimes these challenges will be localized to a country, and other times they may affect just 100 people living in a remote part of Earth. The target audience will keep changing, and so will the models for impacting them in a positive manner. This page serves as a repository for these models and thought structures. 

For more details on Mental Models (which have played) a huge role in shaping our philosophy, we thoroughly recommend [reading up on them.](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)
